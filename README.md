 # Overview

 In my pursuit of enhancing my skills as a software engineer, I set out to create a command-line version of the classic Hangman game using the Rust programming language. 
 The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of Rust's syntax, features, and overall development workflow. By implementing a simple yet interactive game,
 I aimed to explore Rust's unique characteristics and reinforce my programming knowledge.The Hangman game is a text-based application where players guess a hidden word by inputting individual letters.
 The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, displaying the currentstate of the word with underscores for unrevealed letters. The software was written entirely in Rust, leveraging the 
 language's strengths in terms of memory safety, concurrency, and performance. 
The purpose of creating this Hangman game in Rust was twofold. Firstly, I wanted to apply my theoretical knowledge of Rust to a practical project, reinforcing concepts like ownership, 
borrowing, and lifetimes. Secondly, I aimed to demonstrate the versatility and expressiveness of Rust in the context of game development, showcasing how a traditional game could be implemented
efficiently and safely.

# Development Environment
To develop the Hangman game in Rust, I utilized the following tools:
•	Text Editor: Visual Studio Code - for its Rust integration and ease of use.
•	Rust Compiler: The project relied on the official Rust compiler, ensuring compatibility and adherence to Rust best practices. 
•	Rust: Chosen for its focus on safety, performance, and concurrency.
•	Standard Library: Leveraged Rust's standard library for essential functionalities, demonstrating the language's built-in capabilities without external dependencies.

# Future Work 

-  Enhanced User Interface: Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more visually engaging.
-  Dynamic Word Selection: Allow the game to dynamically fetch words from an external source, making each playthrough unique.
- Multiplayer Functionality: Add multiplayer support to enable users to play against each other.
